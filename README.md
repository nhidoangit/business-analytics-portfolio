## About Me

I am passionate about transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions.

I’ve applied SQL, Power BI, Tableau, R, and Python to solve real-world problems — from detecting $21M in financial anomalies to building predictive models that optimize pricing and strategy. I enjoy combining technical analysis with business acumen to uncover opportunities that improve efficiency, reduce risks, and enhance customer engagement.

Beyond technical skills, I bring strong collaboration and communication abilities, honed through leading group projects and managing a digital strategy where I grew engagement by 30%. My goal is to contribute to organizations by leveraging data to inform strategy and create measurable impact.
