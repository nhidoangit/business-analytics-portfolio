## About Me

I am a final-year university student passionate about transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence.

I am proficient in using data to optimize processes, detect anomalies, and drive strategic decision-making. I am eager to apply these skills to solve real-world business problems and am actively seeking an internship in business analytics or a similar role.
